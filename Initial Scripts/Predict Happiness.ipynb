The food in the restaurant was delicious but priced a little on the high side. Of course this is Washington DC. There is no pool and little for children to do. My room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person. The TV is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels. There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them. Severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints. I'm not sure how they knew what room I was in. That was a little unnerving!

I argued that I have a little baby and I would not have booked the room had I known it was smoking. The manager would not hear anything further and told me that Hotwire books the cheapest rooms that are available. So, from the get go I was very unhappy.\\nAfter a great deal of persuasion and discussion, I got a nonsmoking room. Thereafter the room had the most minimal amenities. Besides the great location (near Dupont Circle), there was not much to say about this overpriced hotel. The room was small and in OK condition. The bathroom was small with a tub. The bathroom amenities were also minimal. We did not have a fridge or a microwave and had to again rent a fridge from the staff (to keep baby things).\\nThe parking costs $-- per day so it is best not to drive here. Also the breakfast is not included. The lobby is very small and feels old. The only thing available is coffee in the lobby which is decent.\\nAll in all, poor service, minimal amenities, small rooms, small bathrooms, no view, but great location. Some distance from the metro (either McPherson station or Dupont station). Try to look for better if available.']"

       "[\"Looking for a motel in close proximity to TV taping of a Dr. Phil show, we chose the Dunes on Sunset Blvd in West Hollywood. Although the property displayed the AAA emblem, it certainly left a lot to be desired. There were chips & scrapes on the bottom of the door frame in the bathroom and the lotion containers were half full--apparently not replaced by housekeeping. We needed an early wakeup call, but couldn't use the clock radio alarm as there wasn't a radio in the room. There was no TV channel listing on the remote, or on the TV menu making viewing a chore.The TV remote had to be returned when checking-out. This place served its purpose, but not a place to revisit.\",\n",
       " 'Walking distance to Madison Square Garden and the Penn Subway Station. Also very close to lots of retail stores and restaurants. The hotel offers free internet, a gym and a hot breakfast. Our room was on the top floor facing --th St. The room was clean and the staff very helpful and accommodating. The downside was that the A-C was making a noise and the faucet in the bathroom was loose - things that can be easily fixed. We walked from the hotel to Madison Square Gardens, to Times Square and on to Broadway. Everything considered, I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends.']"
